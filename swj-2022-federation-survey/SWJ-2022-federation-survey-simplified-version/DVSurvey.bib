  abstract_     = {A technical infrastructure for storing, querying and managing RDFdata is a key element in the current semantic web development. Systems like Jena, Sesame or the ICS-FORTH RDF Suite are widelyused for building semantic web applications. Currently, none ofthese systems supports the integrated querying of distributed RDF repositories. We consider this a major shortcoming since the semanticweb is distributed by nature. In this paper we present an architecture for querying distributed RDF repositories by extending the existing Sesame system. We discuss the implications of our architectureand propose an index structure as well as algorithms forquery processing and optimization in such a distributed context.},

These conditions are provided as shapes and other constructs expressed in the form of an RDF graph. RDF graphs that are used in this manner are called "shapes graphs" in SHACL and the RDF graphs that are validated against a shapes graph are called "data graphs". As SHACL shape graphs are used to validate that data graphs satisfy a set of conditions they can also be viewed as a description of the data graphs that do satisfy these conditions. Such descriptions may be used for a variety of purposes beside validation, including user interface building, code generation and data integration.},
